Now the time has come to deploy your app so that it can be publicly available and can be used by users. you choose digital ocean to deploy your app and after struggling to install requirements, configuring your server and now your app finally deployed. Now you slept as you are tired as you worked day and night to convert your dream idea to the product. In the morning, you woke up and you see countless emails as your app hit the market and your server couldn’t handle those requests so it crashed. you added more server to the fleet and sent apology mail to your existing customers, and stating that your app is back in service.</p><p style=\"\">A month later you got one email from digital ocean to pay the amount, it cost you a total of 5000$ but your app is only used by the customer in the first week and you calculated and it should cost 1500$ but the bill is 5000$. why there is a difference of 3500$ ? you now checked, and all those servers you added, cost you that much amount, they were running 24*7. Here if you used serverless than it only costs you 1500$.</p><p style=\"\">In this talk, we will see how can you use serverless to build serverless compliant apps. For the sake of example we will build serverless bots, nowadays Bot is serving to help people with their required information. You do not need an expensive internet connection to talk to the bot, but you need an expensive server to run your bot but not with the case with the serverless.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Benefits of serverless</strong> <strong>No Administration</strong> - We can deploy our code without provisioning anything beforehand, or manage anything afterward. There is no concept of a fleet, an instance, or even an operating system.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Scalability</strong> - One doesn’t have to care about auto-scaling, No need to show alerts or write scripts to scale up and down. With serverless, we can handle quick bursts of traffic.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Cost</strong> - Function-as-a-service (FaaS) compute and managed services charged based on actual usage rather than pre-provisioned capacity. This means one pay the amount we use, so if we use service for 10 sec then we pay for 10 sec.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Faster Development</strong> - Now loop between having an idea and deploying to production is shortened because no one need to manage anything after deployment, smaller teams can ship more features. It’s easier than ever to make your idea live.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Easy Integration</strong> - With Other Services Going serverless allows a seamless integration to various other cloud services from the same provider. For example, if you are using the AWS platform for chatbots, then you can use DynamoDB for the database, write programming logic as Lambda functions, and expose them through the API Gateway.</p>Session key Takeaways<p style=\"\">The main question is how to write code which is serverless compliant. This is where this session will help you.

Some automation tools and services are provided by cloud\nvendors themselves. But all those services come with vendor lock: they’ll only\ndeploy within their own environments.</p><p>BENEFIT OF USING TERRAFORM</p><p>Build your entire Huawei Cloud Family infrastructure with one command.\nServers, network, storage, DNS, CDNs, load balancers, and much more all have\nAPIs. Terraform is a tool to model all of these resources in a single language\nacross multiple cloud providers, then bring then up and connect them all in a\nsingle command. Terraform can then be used to model changes to your Huawei\ninfrastructure and safely effect those changes. Terraforms safety comes from\nthe ability to \"plan\" changes: Terraform shows you an execution plan\nof what it will do before it does it. You can then determine if a change is\nsafe or not and whether to apply it. Along with this safety Terraform is highly\nresistant to errors: it retries failed operations and is idempotent and can be\nrun again if an operation cannot complete the first time. In this talk we\npresent the problems faced in automating infrastructure and how Terraform is\nbeing used to solve them in production.</p><p> </p><p>USE CASES:</p><p>•             Orchestrate and\nOptimize multi-cloud/tier deployments on OpenStack Clouds using Opensource\ntechnology-Terraform</p><p>Terraform is meant to help you combine all the components you’ll need to\nbuild and launch your application infrastructure. It's often attractive to\nspread infrastructure across multiple clouds to increase fault-tolerance. By\nusing only a single region or cloud provider, fault tolerance is limited by the\navailability of that provider. Having a multi-cloud deployment allows for more\ngraceful recovery of the loss of a region or entire provider.</p><p> </p><p>Realizing multi-cloud deployments can be very challenging as many\nexisting tools for infrastructure management are cloud-specific. Terraform is\ncloud-agnostic and allows a single configuration to be used to manage multiple\nproviders, and to even handle cross-cloud dependencies. This simplifies\nmanagement and orchestration, helping operators build large-scale multi-cloud\ninfrastructures.</p><p> </p><p>You could, for instance, select a base server from Huawei Cloud, DNS\nfrom Open Telekom Cloud, and a Postgres database from Telefonica Open Cloud.\nTerraform will build a single application framework from across all these\nproviders in parallel.</p><p> </p><p>A very common pattern is the N-tier architecture. The most common 2-tier\narchitecture is a pool of web servers that use a database tier.</p><p>Terraform is an ideal tool for building and managing these infrastructures.\nEach tier can be described as a collection of resources, and the dependencies\nbetween each tier are handled automatically; Terraform will ensure the database\ntier is available before the web servers are started and that the load\nbalancers are aware of the web nodes.

We operate at a massive scale and do a good portion of our overall GO-JEK monthly orders of a 100+ million via GO-FOOD. With 300K+ merchants, there is not only a huge variety for customers to choose from but the discovery of restaurants becomes a challenge. There was a need for improving the search experience of the user so that they can find their favorite merchants quicker, rather than to scroll through pages trying to find them. The idea of Butler was to customize the search results so as to take into account the past order history and preferred cuisines of the user. We wanted to essentially improve our Click Through Rate(percentage of merchant page visits per search sessions) and Booking Conversion Rate(percentage of search sessions that result in a booking). In this talk, we will cover the current architecture for GO-FOOD search, how we personalized the search experience through Butler and how we trained our model by collecting feedback from search results.</p><p>\n\n<b>The architecture of GO-FOOD Search</b>\n\n</p>\n<p>GO-FOOD Search architecture is a combination of Elasticsearch and Postgres. We use Elasticsearch for search and ranking of the merchants and Postgres serves as the source of truth for getting merchant details. For each search request, we first query Elasticsearch which ranks the merchants according to the search query. The search query mostly takes into account that the merchant is open and takes into account the distance from the user for the ranking. After fetching the restaurant details from Elasticsearch, we query Postgres for getting merchant details. The returned response is a combination of Elasticsearch and Postgres response.</p><p><b>Coming up with Search Personalization Architecture</b></p><p>When tasked with personalizing search results, we had to first analyze how to come up with the following: a. Fetching customer information like favorite merchants, favorite cuisine information and taking it into account for ranking merchants b. Creating a Learning To Rank model that can be used for ranking merchants</p>\n<p>a. Fetching Customer Preference Information We have an internal batch processing product named Tagstore/Tagstream which populates customer data with information about his past order history and browsing history. It also takes into account the cuisine and merchant information for which he ordered in the last 1 month and 6 months. This data is updated on a daily basis and fetching this data was just a lookup to retrieve customer information and use it to personalize the search results.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>b. Creating a learning model While analyzing our options for using a model to rank the restaurants, we found that a plugin called LearnToRank(LTR) using which we can use a learning to rank model against our searches. The initial model took into account features that capture customer-merchant browsing and ordering interactions along with the distance between the merchant and customer . A relevance by query dataset that summarizes the judgement a user made on each search listing was prepared and an LTR model that was trained using <span>Ranklib</span>.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Ranklib offers a suite of ML algorithms that can be used to train ranking models. The algorithm that we chose for initial experimentation was LambdaMART given that we wanted initial iterations of the model to be as interpretable as possible while using state of the art LTR models.</p>\n<p>The LambdaMART algorithm learns an ensemble of regression trees that work over each of the features given to it and maps each merchant-customer combination to one of the tree nodes along with the boost in score that should be attributed to that search listing so as to maximize a ranking quality metric. The non discounted cumulative gain(nDCG) metric computes the quality of each search result depending on the ranking positions at which the clicks and bookings occured in comparison to the best possible search ranking that could have been presented to the user.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personalizing Search Results with Butler </b></p>\n<p>Butler is a golang app that serves as the endpoint for serving the search results from elasticsearch. With every search request, we take into account the customer id, customer location and tile that the user has selected(Example: nearby restaurants, restaurants which are open 24*7, best selling merchants etc). For personalizing the elasticsearch response, we first fetch the customer details from the tagstore that we discussed previously. After this we pass in the customer preference information as a parameter to the model in the search query. The model is used to rescore the elasticsearch documents and we get personalized response for a user’s search request. When rolling out personalized search, we made sure that we roll it out only to a certain percentage of the search traffic. So we created a rollout end point for each tile, so that we can first test the personalized results for a particular tile and compare the results. Since user trends vary across different tiles, rolling it out to different tiles and measuring the non personalized vs personalized results made more sense. We also created a live dashboard that shows the booking conversion and search click conversion. Using this we were able to track how our personalized search performed against our traditional search.</p><p><b>Creating a Feedback cycle to train model from Search Results </b></p>\n<p>As part of our initial efforts, we were just tracking the SLAs, booking and search click conversions. We were not tracking the scores that LTR provides to each restaurant by considering the customer profile information. We realized that this was very vital information to train the current model. In Order to collect these metrics, we enabled LTR metric logging in the search query. After collecting the LTR metrics, we push these metrics along with the customer information to kafka.</p>\n<p>From kafka, we have cold storage pipeline setup which pushes the kafka data to GCS. The search data as well the positions at which the user clicked and made bookings from is pushed to GCS via kafka as well. These data sources are used now to create the judgement dataset that can act as the training data for the next iteration of the LTR model.</p><p></p>\n<p><b>Next steps with Search Personalization </b></p><p><b></b>As an improvement to the search personalization experience, we want to improve the model performance by taking into account more information about customer-merchant interaction. For example we want to use take into account the primary cuisine information of the merchant so that when users search for the cuisine we can prioritize the merchant. From a technical point of view, we want the ability to run multiple learning models at the same time and compare the results from the various experiments.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"A Butler for Everyone: Personalising Search Results for GO-FOOD","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4995","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#e55e1e","id":"1070"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"maulik.soneji@go-jek.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":"Bangalore","position":"Product Engineer","short-biography":"<p>A</p>","instagram":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-email-overridden":false,"sponsorship-required":null,"organisation":"Go-JEK","twitter":null,"name":"Maulik Soneji","long-biography":null,"mobile":"9427802453","gender":"Male","country":"India","is-featured":null,"website":null,"thumbnail-image-url":null,"facebook":null,"linkedin":null,"small-image-url":null,"github":null,"icon-image-url":null,"photo-url":null,"id":"3708"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/3689bc98/sessions?include=track%2Cmicrolocation%2Csession-type%2Cspeakers&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2019-01-30T11:00:44.924469+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2018-09-23T19:22:59.989300+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2019-03-14T13:00:00+00:00","level":"Intermediate","submitted-at":"2019-01-30T11:00:44.924469+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p><span><span style=\"\">Cloud solution architects and DevOps engineers want to have a faster conversion from idea to product.

Based on these issues I decided to build a prototype that can solve these<b><i> real time issues</i></b>.</p><p><b>Idea :</b> Using <i>IoT</i> based devices a simplified architecture is made to define geological and geographical conditions of a farm(agricultural field).

The geological conditions(physical) of soil can be measured using pressure and moisture probes by placing them inside the soil and the geographical conditions(atmospheric) such as temperature, humidity pressure and gases(nitrogen and Oxygen) required by the crop for growing well can be measured using temperature and gas sensors that are connected to the box in such a way that it forms a medium between external atmospheric conditions and soil. The whole data measured by the sensors can be operated and processed in a <i>raspberry-pi(</i>this series connection of sensors to raspberry-pi can be given using an<i> Arduino nano or an I2C)</i>, then finally the processed data like temperature, moisture and pressure in the soil can be specifically seen in an Android app where the whole info from raspberry-pi is sent to cloud.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b> : This device will help the farmers and cultivators in different village to grow crops with suitable soil.</p><p><i>pressure humidity sensors:</i> BME 280 sensors </p><p><i>gases measuring sensors:</i> MQ series sensors depending upon the gas in atmosphere.  EX: MQ 4 for methane and MQ 7 for CO </p><p>soil moisture and pressure monitoring module - 12 v (135636)</p><p>Raspberry-pi to cloud medium - <i>cayenne IoT software</i> </p><p><i style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Applications :  </i>1.

Now its above  90% on an average.  So how did we turn this around?</p><p>1. We found out most noshowers are habitual/repeat offenders. We now keep a blacklist -&gt; any no shows are automatically put in this list and are barred from any of our meetups for one year. </p><p>2. Our screening have become stricter: We now ask a potential registrant queries regarding their theme experience[our monthly meetups revolve around a single theme: like either DevOps or Python or Mobility etc] and OSS contributions. This was wholly manual and extremely time consuming. We are now using elements of AI/ML to validate and assign a score. Its a WIP but it is progressively getting more accurate as we accumulate more data. This alone has made for a healthy curated audience.</p><p>3. One reason we are moving to open event is that Eventbrite does not expose an API endpoint for checkins : its only possible via their desktop site or their mobile apps. i.e. only a single organizer can checkin folks. Now we are using Computer Vision to recognize attendees and mark their attendance and checkin them for the various sessions and tracks via the Open Event mobile apps. </p><p>The solution is OSS and the talk + demo will involve:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence ( Algorithms, Cognitive Expert Systems,)</p><p>DevOps (Continuous Delivery, Lean IT, Moving at Cloud-speed)</p><p>Cloud &amp; Microservices (Containers - Libraries, Runtimes, Composition; Kubernetes; Docker, Distributed Services)</p><p>Thank you</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","is-locked":false,"id":"5130","track":{"name":"Open Data, Internet, Community","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#4de3a1","id":"1072"},"microlocation":{"name":"Event Hall 1-2 (Community Stage)","floor":1,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"876"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"augcor@gmail.com","speaking-experience":"<p>I have been organizing meetups and speaking at them for the last 7 years. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/augustine-correa-3582300793\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eventbrite.com/o/augustine-correa-3582300793</a></p>","complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":"Social media","city":"Mumbai","position":"CTO","short-biography":"<p>Organizer of the largest OSS community <a href=\"http://fb.com/hackmum\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fb.com/hackmum</a> in Bombay and its longest running tech meetup (over 5 years) <a href=\"http://fb.com/mumtechup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fb.com/mumtechup</a> [#mumtechup] in Bombay</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/augustine-correa-3582300793\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eventbrite.com/o/augustine-correa-3582300793</a></p><p>Docker Mumbai Community Leader</p><p>Kubernetes Mumbai, Hashicorp Mumbai &amp; DCOS Mumbai meetup organizer</p><p>Meteor Mumbai captain</p><p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/members/26318352/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.meetup.com/members/26318352/</a></p><p></p><p>Microsoft MVP 2018-19</p>","instagram":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-email-overridden":false,"sponsorship-required":null,"organisation":"Hackerspace Mumbai","twitter":"http://twitter.com/hackmum","name":"Augustine Correa","long-biography":null,"mobile":"9821443069","gender":"Male","country":"India","is-featured":null,"website":null,"thumbnail-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3825/thumbnail/Vll0bTZ4Ul/32e45b88-8435-433b-b913-aebfcd2b731f.jpg","facebook":"http://fb.com/hackmum","linkedin":null,"small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3825/small/K3luSGtieX/624dc62e-cef8-4493-b641-99c71f2ba957.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3825/icon/VXdhSjZmbW/113739cb-d5a3-4b41-bdbb-887b3e942d23.jpg","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3825/photo/QVpia3g3NS/d97708b0-72d7-4512-b2bd-6dbe38abec62.png","id":"3825"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/3689bc98/sessions?include=track%2Cmicrolocation%2Csession-type%2Cspeakers&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2019-01-13T07:36:05.509364+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2018-12-01T08:12:57.438116+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2019-03-14T13:00:00+00:00","level":"Beginner","submitted-at":"2019-01-13T07:36:05.509364+00:00","state":"rejected","short-abstract":"<p>Have you ever been at a carnival and had your age guessed in one of those quiz games?

During the Google Summer of Code 2018, we had a number of new features and enhancements made to the SUSI server and clients. The most important part of the <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> project is its skills. We aim to provide quality user experience through the skills that we have. And, to develop and improve upon the existing skills, we needed reviews and feedback from the user. Hence, a new skill rating and feedback system have been developed which allows the users to rate the skills using a five-star rating system and also provides them with a section where they can add their feedback. In case, they find any skill inappropriate, they can also report the skill. The skill rating and feedback system serve as a channel through which we get to know the needs and expectations of our users, which in turn adds to our motivation to consistently improve upon the existing skills.</p><p>Along with these new features, the clients have a new UI and the skills have been organised in a better way to provide faster access to more useful skills as per the need of the user. Also, the skills load 10x faster than they used to. A number of features, like changing the skill language, addition of more languages, etc., have been added to the web and Android/iOS clients to provide a more personalised experience to the user.</p><p>I would discuss all of the above features that I have worked on during my GSoC this year and would discuss its implementation and the technologies that have been used. I would also demonstrate how the users can help us improve the SUSI skills by providing their constructive feedback. I would also try to motivate people to contribute to our projects and help us build more robust skills that can give better responses because the intelligence of <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> lies with SUSI skills.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16ok-Vhb9lp4PznHqZ85xmVMF0YMRZFefCuLk2-RK1vE/edit?usp=sharing","is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Revamping SUSI.AI","comments":"<p></p>","is-locked":false,"id":"5127","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Mobile Technologies","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#00e1ef","id":"1073"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"arundhatigupta2411@gmail.com","speaking-experience":"<p>I have been one of the speakers at Jugaadfest 2018, Hyderabad, India.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are attractive options for platform providers to realize edge clouds.

The mechanism has been tested on an emulated P2P environment with up to 3000 nodes. The evaluation suggests that the state maintained on a node grows logarithmically with N, the total number of P2P nodes in the system. Additionally, a new node joining the P2P system requires log (N) steps to converge through our mechanism. Additionally, a valid search query within the scope of the search index is completed with log (N) steps.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Location-based Search Service for a P2P Could System","comments":"<p>You can find the document version here: <a href=\"http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240416\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-240416</a>.

This intervention comes at a time when divisive behaviours such as hate speech, fake news, ethnic and religious uprisings etc. are rife around the country. </p><p>The programme is designed to run for 2 years, with each geo-political zone in Nigeria hosting an event at least once. Expected outputs from the Series will include: Open Source Hardware/Software products; documentary film of the series, highlighting collaboration between Nigerian youth, irrespective of ethnic, religious, political or social backgrounds and affiliations; established networks across communities - geographical and ideological.</p><p><b>Methodology for the National Hackathon Series</b></p><p>The hackathon participants are grouped in teams to tinker, design, develop and document technology solutions to problems within their communities using the SDG goals as a guide for identifying problems. This hackathon is not a competition but a collaboration. There are no prizes won! The participants are solution driven for their communities.</p><p>The hackathons also feature interactive dialogue sessions where participants will gain practical insight into peaceful co-existence, from a high-level panel of religious and traditional leaders, media practitioners, representatives of the academia and the organised private sector.</p><p>Our strategy is to use technology and entertainment [embedding unconference sessions to show documentary films that teach good values to participants] as an enabler for national cohesion and integration and in the process induce civic participation.</p><p>After each hackathon, the new participants join the general makers' community of other participants who have attended previous hackathons. </p><p><b>Expected Output of Session</b></p><p>A panel discussion to; </p><ul><li>report the National Hackathon Series held in Nigeria and its role in technology inclusion for global peace advocacy.</li><li>discuss the effect of social media fake news and hate speech on global community conflicts. </li></ul><p></p><p><b>Links</b></p><p><a href=\"https://vilsquare.org/makershub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://vilsquare.org/makershub</a><b></b></p><p></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Creating an Enabler Platform for Inclusive Technology to Drive National Cohesion and Integration in Global Communities","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"5074","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Open Data, Internet, Community","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#4de3a1","id":"1072"},"session-type":{"name":"Panel","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:55","id":"566"},"speakers":[{"email":"obateke@yahoo.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":"Website","city":"Abuja","position":"Co-Founder | CTO","short-biography":"<p><span style=\"\">Obasegun is the Co-founder and Executive Director at Vilsquare.

Loading too much DOM nodes will slow your site, especially on low-end devices. Only rendering the part the user wants to see can provide huge performance gains. Windowing is rendering just enough content to fill the screen and continuously updating the DOM as the user scrolls. In this talk, participants will learn how windowing works and how to implement basic windowing in their code from scratch. We will discuss some use cases for windowing and explore some windowing libraries like react-window, react virtualized and virtual-scroller.</p><p><b style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></b></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><b>Outline:</b></span></p><ol style=\"\"><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">The problem: rendering large no. of nodes slows down the page (rendering process).</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Use Cases (Demo): Large Tables, chat, contact list.</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Windowing: how it works</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Demo: with windowing</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">How to implement windowing (basic version)</span></p></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Discussing Windowing libraries: virtual scroller, react virtualize, react window etc.</span></p></li></ol><p><b style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></b></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><b>Requirements:</b></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none;\">Web &amp; Javascript knowledge.</span></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Rendering large volumes of data in the browser using windowing","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"5043","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Web Technologies","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#f9ff00","id":"1064"},"session-type":{"name":"Extended Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:45","id":"563"},"speakers":[{"email":"hello@rohanm.com","speaking-experience":"<ol><li>Taught junior's about web programming and networking in college as part of a study group. </li><li>Given tech talks at Clarisights about react design patterns and unit testing.</li></ol>","complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":"Social media","city":"Bangalore","position":"Technical Lead","short-biography":"<p>I am the technical lead at Clarisights (Techstars' 2018) where I created the front end of the platform from scratch which is used by enterprise customers from more than 40 countries.

This talk concludes with a brief exploration of some of Betrusted's goals and design features.Project page: https://betrusted.ioSocial media: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bunniestudios\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/bunniestudios</a></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T10:05:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"For Your Eyes Only: Betrusted & the Case for Trusted I/O","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"5230","track":{"name":"Hardware & Design","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#b35d16","id":"1063"},"microlocation":{"name":"Lecture Theatre","floor":3,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"757"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"bunnie@fossasia.org","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":null,"position":"CTO","short-biography":"<p>Bunnie is best known for his work hacking the Microsoft Xbox, as well as for his efforts in designing and manufacturing open source hardware, including the chumby (app-playing alarm clock), chibitronics (teaching electronics through arts and crafts), and Novena (DIY laptop).</p>","instagram":null,"deleted-at":null,"is-email-overridden":false,"sponsorship-required":null,"organisation":"Chibitronics","twitter":"https://twitter.com/chibitronics","name":"Bunnie Huang","long-biography":null,"mobile":"3456789","gender":"Male","country":"USA","is-featured":null,"website":"https://chibitronics.com/","thumbnail-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3905/thumbnail/ZjZ5T1B5Wm/96317aab-76bf-4652-8761-2aa6d5fead02.jpg","facebook":null,"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bunnie-huang-b98910/","small-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3905/small/YXJBblFNa1/7a99a440-632f-49f6-8b44-5ff44ea42275.jpg","github":null,"icon-image-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3905/icon/akZqaWJ1TF/a9192458-26fb-4648-945e-7de721b959b5.jpg","photo-url":"https://storage.eventyay.com/eventyay.com/events/598/speakers/3905/photo/ZjNxQVV6TT/37f8ff65-b861-44be-8583-16a70c693ecd.png","id":"3905"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/3689bc98/sessions?include=track%2Cmicrolocation%2Csession-type%2Cspeakers&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"complex-field-values":null,"long-abstract":null,"last-modified-at":"2019-01-13T14:14:42.377282+00:00","deleted-at":null,"created-at":"2019-01-09T04:19:11.489076+00:00","subtitle":null,"audio-url":null,"ends-at":"2019-03-16T18:45:00+00:00","level":"Advanced","submitted-at":"2019-01-13T14:14:42.377282+00:00","state":"confirmed","short-abstract":"<p style=\"\">There is a long research tradition in the field of science and technology studies (STS) showing the importance of the social in technical design processes. The notion sociotechnical design practices, for example, stands for tight entanglements and co-shaping processes of technical and social elements. Following this basic assumption critical algorithm studies, infrastructure studies, and software studies have started to investigate how social biases in big data, preferences of designers and coders, or imaginations of future users shape digital tools, software, or artificial intelligence. Moreover, innovative methods have been developed to not only analyze, but also problematize and intervene in software practices. “De-biasing” has become an issue of concern bringing together computer scientists and social scientists to learn from each other in the attempt to bring fairness, accountability and transparency to the table of software design.</p><p style=\"\">Following this research tradition the proposed workshop tries to bring together developers, coders, researchers and other contributors working on <a href=\"http://SUSI.AI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SUSI.AI</a> to address the following question: “Where is SUSI in the AI”?

For example implementation of the most famous i18n framework gettext spans C/C++, Python, PHP, Java, JS, .NET and many others. Web development frameworks (like Django, Spring, Rails, Drupal, etc.) may have their own method. Some keep their language resources in PO (gettext portable object) format, others in JSON, YML, INI, RESX, PROPERTIES etc. i18n methods are being evaluated and enhanced which results in multilingual web pages getting much popularity.</p><p></p><p>Modern web applications include various frameworks mixedup, which actually takes i18n into more complex level.

Finally we will show how Falco can trigger functions to stop abnormal behavior, &amp; isolate the compromised Pod or Node for forensics. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of what problems runtime security solves, &amp; how Falco can provide runtime security &amp; incident response.</span></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Container Runtime Security with Falco","comments":"<p>this can also be a 25 minute session if required.</p>","is-locked":false,"id":"5150","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Cybersecurity","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#b4a7d6","id":"1119"},"session-type":{"name":"Extended Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:45","id":"563"},"speakers":[{"email":"michael@ducy.org","speaking-experience":"<p>Michael is an internationally recognized speaker on a variety of topics such as containers, DevOps, cloud computing, organizational culture.

So this idea offers a solution to this critical problem. This is a Blockchain application which is built to address different problem areas with scope to manipulate criminal records such as 'change of data entered in the F.I.R', irregularities due to corruption, lack of transparency , fake test reports to mislead the courts , and police facing difficulty in searching criminals.  In the present scenario F.I.R’s are stored manually, police stick criminal information at public places to create awareness. Test reports are submitted  manually to the judge and police verify the people who check-in in the hotels manually.  This application acts as a single source of truth for all the above mentioned problem areas. The F.I.R s and criminals data are registered into Blockchain application and this database is shared with the hotels and public transport systems to verify the people who check-in or travel. Now-a-days, the DNA or any sort of test reports that are to be submitted in the courts are manipulated.  To prevent this from happening, the application allows the judge to access the medical test reports directly, eliminating the middle men which reduces the scope of manipulation to a maximum extent.  Currently we considered six stake holders namely police, courts, C.I.D, diagnostic centers, hospitals and hotels. The application imbibes high level of security standards , hence issues related to manipulation of records can be eliminated to a maximum extent. As the details of the application are  transparent and accessible , the public will be aware of criminal proceedings. This application is bound to instill confidence in public on the legal proceedings. Fairness in transactions is thus ensured boosting in the economy in long run.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"PartnerInCrime","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4981","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Blockchain","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#f0d02b","id":"1067"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"kalidindisahitya98@gmail.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":"Website","city":"Hyderabad","position":"Student","short-biography":"<p>Hey.!

The platform can be used by developers to build DApps for conducting polls/surveys. The online polling/survey system is developed to enable people around the world to provide their vote on the survey/poll form designed using the platform. The platform is developed using Blockchain Technology mainly because of Blockchain’s  transparency and reliability.  This platform is developed in such a way that the intermediary results are not revealed to public and secrecy is maintained till the deadline. The survey/poll in these applications can be posted by famous public figures in order to reach a wider audience. This platform offers relevant packages that can be utilized to create appropriate polling applications by the developers. The methodology provided by the platform is transparent to the public and it cannot be modified. And any modifications made to it will have an audit trail which will be visible. This platform can be utilized in number of ways. It can be used widely at the time of elections. It can also be used to gather public opinions on various government decisions. </p><p>   Blockchain is well known for the four main features, namely immutability, transparency, provenance, and being the single source of truth. Our platform supports all the four features. Polls/surveys conducted in traditional methods can be manipulated to favor certain sections, but polling applications created by using the Blockchain Technology will not have scope for manipulation. Hence it is immutable. This platform provides transparency offering visibility of poll outcomes to every one. The history of the surveys/poll are available in the platform, the data can only be appended but not updated, in tandem with the provenance feature. Finally the platform supports the  feature of being the single source of truth. Hence it can also be used as legally acceptable source. In short It's expected to be a game changer.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T12:00:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"PollBlock","comments":null,"is-locked":false,"id":"4980","microlocation":null,"track":{"name":"Blockchain","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#f0d02b","id":"1067"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"yarra.yoshitha@gmail.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":"Google or other search","city":"Hyderabad","position":"Student","short-biography":"<p>Hi!

MySQL is world's most popular open source database and caching the data has always been a very interesting problem involving database usage design. Using cache instead of fetching from disk makes the response time time exponentially fast. In this swift world with manifold use cases for software, there are use cases of intelligent caching. This involves pre polluting the cache directly from data source before cached data is requested from Redis. Pre population of cache can be done as follows based on use case:</p><p>- pre populate the cache before starting application.</p><p>  This makes the application faster from beginning as required data is already cached.</p><p>- populate a set of key, value once a key matching a pattern is set in cache</p><p>  This case is based on sequential multiple disk access as application is executed. When a key is populated in disk, the probability of other related keys increases. For example, if when a user logged in the website, the changes of him accessing his profile increases. The use case is more significant in different scenario.</p><p>- Never let a cache expire</p><p>  Set a key/pattern of keys to a group which will always be present in the cache. If it is deleted from cache, it will be fetched from the data source and cache will be auto populated.</p><p>  This case fits best for the keys which are frequently used buy frequently expires too.</p><p>The talk will comprehensively discuss above scenarios with MySQL plugin for redistribution caching, showing the improvement with the smart caching and how to integrate it in some of the applications.</p><p></p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-16T17:15:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/fSCmmg3XlOA","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"MySQL Smart Plugin for caching with Redis","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"5108","track":{"name":"Database","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#26921d","id":"1065"},"microlocation":{"name":"Training room 2-1","floor":2,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"764"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"abhishekranjan5466@gmail.com","speaking-experience":"<span style=\"\"><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Presented on \"Metadata Storage for Transactional Databases\" representing MySQL team in FOSSASIA, Singapore, 2016.

Networked Linux machines more and more take over tasks formerly executed by Mainframe systems. With those tasks also comes the workload which has to be managed and automated. New technologies like Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing and Big Data also require the execution of numerous programs interconnected by dependencies and synchronization needs. To manage those workloads, the use of Enterprise Job Scheduling or Workload Automation systems is self-evident in Mainframe environments for decades. In Linux environments this software class is not widely spread and automation is done using cron, built in scheduling functionality of systems like ETL tools and a bunch of scripts. This creates a numerous amount of problems regarding transparency, maintainability, stability and efficiency. One reason for this development was the lack of an Open Source Workload Automation System able to satisfy the demands. Since 2013 the schedulix Open Source Enterprise Job Scheduling System closes this gap and gives an extremely powerful and reliable tool into the hands of Linux system administrators and software developers. The other reason is the lack of knowledge on this software class and which huge benefits job scheduling systems can deliver. This talk is aimed to change this and to give the audience an introduction to what schedulix can do to establish an efficient, reliable and cost effective IT Workload Automation.","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-15T14:30:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/UZY-FmGPeM8","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Scalable IT Workload Automation","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"5168","track":{"name":"Cloud, Containers, DevOps","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#a117a3","id":"1071"},"microlocation":{"name":"Lecture Theatre","floor":3,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"757"},"session-type":{"name":"Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:25","id":"564"},"speakers":[{"email":"dieter.stubler@independit.de","speaking-experience":"<p>25 years of experience in performing talks, lectures and workshops in the field of Relational Database Management Systems, Data Warehousing and IT Workload Automation.</p>","complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":null,"position":"Executive Director","short-biography":"<p>Born 1963 in Schrobenhausen Germany.

The idea was that openness prevails. Talking about the Freedom of Information Act at that time Obama said that openness \"means more than simply informing the American people how decisions are made.\" It also means recognizing that the government doesn’t have all the answers. To that end, he directed members of his administration to \"find new ways of tapping the knowledge of ordinary Americans\" — scientists, educators, entrepreneurs — to find ways to solve the problems of our times. While his message as the US president was directed towards Americans, for the FOSS community, developers, designers, content creators, makers, entrepreneurs and of course companies active in our community “openness prevails” has always been true. Openness for us is not just an idea to access information, it is the basis for amazing collaboration models in the FOSS community. </p><p>At FOSSASIA developers work across time zones, countries, and continents and anyone can join development. Imagine how difficult it would be to develop our products if we had to get everyone to sign NDAs and Copyright agreements. This would cause a huge overhead, but there are different models and possibilities to how what extend openness can prevail and in this panel we would like to get insights into how open development, open communication, open tools and technologies, open knowledge and open collaboration has benefited organizations and work of our panelists.</p><p></p><p>In the second part of the panel we would like to talk about the future. What are plans of panelists for the future in their organization in regards to opening up and creating new opportunities? And in the bigger picture how will society change and open up and what opportunities and challenges lie in opening up areas of society? Panelists will answer these questions from their specific point of view as managers of a large tech corporation, successful Open Hardware makers, representatives of a community driven Open Tech company, or a manager in a computer processor company.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-14T11:40:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/8NP2PMP1AFw","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Business, Government, Science - What Opportunities Does \"Open\" Bring to Society?","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"5223","track":{"name":"Open Data, Internet, Community","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#000000","color":"#4de3a1","id":"1072"},"microlocation":{"name":"Lecture Theatre","floor":3,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"757"},"session-type":{"name":"Panel","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:55","id":"566"},"speakers":[{"email":"mariobehling@gmail.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":"Berlin","position":"CEO","short-biography":"<p><span></span></p><p style=\"\"><span style=\"\">Mario Behling is the CEO of OpnTec.

Packages are downloaded, configured and demoed within minutes.</p>","signup-url":null,"starts-at":"2019-03-16T17:10:00+00:00","average-rating":null,"language":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/dVWc6fYMJKA","slides-url":null,"is-mail-sent":false,"title":"Accessible Machine Learning - MLHub","comments":"","is-locked":false,"id":"5078","track":{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","description":null,"deleted-at":null,"font-color":"#ffffff","color":"#e55e1e","id":"1070"},"microlocation":{"name":"Event Hall 2-1","floor":2,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"deleted-at":null,"room":null,"id":"755"},"session-type":{"name":"Extended Talk","deleted-at":null,"length":"00:45","id":"563"},"speakers":[{"email":"fossasia@togaware.com","speaking-experience":null,"complex-field-values":null,"heard-from":null,"city":null,"position":"Director of Data Science","short-biography":"<p>Graham has been an open source developer since the 1980's, with early contributions to emacs, TeX, Debian, R, and is the developer of various Machine Learning toolkits.

This makes communication with mute people really difficult. Most of the teaching methods for deaf and dumb involve accommodating them to people without disabilities - while discouraging the sign language.  To make it easier for people to communicate with deaf and dumb people, I had attempted to use tensorflow to interpret sign language. As of now the system can recognize only alphabets and work is in progress to interpret complete words. The talk will be divide in two parts.

It is a multifunctional end to end semi-autonomous system which operates differently in urban and rural areas based on their individual requirements. In semi-urban and rural areas, there is a need to provide access to specialised doctors and medical supplies as these are unavailable in their community hospitals. AERPS  leverages medical image processing and deep learning using OpenCV and TensorFlow to accurately predict the presence of disease like ischemic strokes and based on the diagnosis, allows the community hospital to order for medical supplies. The medical supplies are delivered using a drone enhanced with edge AI to run intelligent algorithms enabling it to ensure that the medicines are only delivered to authorised people and providing accurate obstacle avoidance thus making delivery in hard to reach places easier. In congested urban areas, an interactive chatbot with the ability to predict ailments based on patient symptoms informs the medical personnel who approves the delivery of medicines thus providing quick delivery of medical supplies where traffic is a major roadblock in providing medical assistance.
